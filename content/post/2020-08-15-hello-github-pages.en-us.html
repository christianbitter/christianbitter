<p>After some time of the grid, my personal blog is now back online - here on github. As a potential source of inspiration and documentation, I can highly recommend the following blogpost, which enabled me to set this up here - Thanks to <a href="https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/#a-new-post-in-blogdown">Aurora Mareviv and Tales of Fr</a>.</p>
<p>Read you soon!</p>
