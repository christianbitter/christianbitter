<p>When analyzing and making investments we typically have to face a trade-off between
how much risk (or uncertainty) we are going to allow to affect our investment,
and how strong our appetite for gains or returns is. Typically, we know that
an investment that has larger swings in either positive or negative direction
and an investment that has more of such swings is an investment that we would consider
as being riskier when compared to an investment that stays flatter overall
(e.g, less pronounced swings and less dynamic). For example, putting 10$ bill in
my pocket is less risky than putting it into a stock.</p>
<p>A famous benchmark data set that charts the historic performance/ risk of bonds
and stocks for the last 100 years or so, is the Fama French data set made available
by Professor Kenneth French. Actually, there is a multitude of different data sets
available on his website. But for the time being we focus on the 3 Factor data set.
The data set provides an historic aggregation over many stocks and bonds traded
by or on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ. As such it serves as a perfect index to compare
your asset or portfolio to.</p>
<p>In order to use the data set in R, I wrote a small piece of code utilizing the
base and typical tidyverse packages, i.e.Â readr for reading a csv file, dplyr
for data engineering and lubridate for date handling.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39;@title Auxiliary Data

#&#39;@author Christian Bitter
#&#39;@description Downloads the Fama French 3 Factor data set and structures it as
#&#39;monthly and yearly components. Each component provides the same factors
#&#39;More information about the data can be found Rm-Rf (the excess return on the market, value-weight return),
#&#39;SMB (Small minus big), HML (High minus Low) and Rf (risk free rate).
#&#39;here: \url{https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/f-f_factors.html}.
#&#39;@returns A list with two entries yearly and monthly representing the FF yearly
#&#39;and monthly aggregates.

    dplyr::mutate(RmxRf = RmxRf / 100.,
                  Rf = Rf / 100.);

  yearly_df &lt;- data_df %&gt;%
    dplyr::filter(date &lt; 10000) %&gt;%
    dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date, truncated = 2L));

  return(list(
    &quot;yearly&quot; = yearly_df,
    &quot;monthly&quot; = monthly_df
  ));
