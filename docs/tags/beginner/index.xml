      <description>Dear fellows, lately I have dabbled with drawing some simple 2D pixel art. As a great wannabe, I acquired Aseprite, one of the du-jour tools to draw pixel art. Letâ€™s see if the choice of software goes along with talent and output quality. In the near future we plan to make parts of our progress available in a git repository, so that you can use our playground experiments for your own purpose.</description>
