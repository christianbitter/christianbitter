      <description>Unfortunately, the last couple of weeks weren’t as Elisa-productive as I had anticipated. Partly, this was due to the typical work-buzz that surrounds the starting into a new year, i.e. everyone is full of anticipation and wants to carry the new year’s resolution momentum into the workplace. Specifically, this meant a lot of communication and coordination leading to low to no eagerness to engage Elisa or Python or game programming for that matter outside of work.</description>

      <description>Dear fellows, lately I have dabbled with drawing some simple 2D pixel art. As a great wannabe, I acquired Aseprite, one of the du-jour tools to draw pixel art. Let’s see if the choice of software goes along with talent and output quality. In the near future we plan to make parts of our progress available in a git repository, so that you can use our playground experiments for your own purpose.</description>
