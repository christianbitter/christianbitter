      <description>My aim with this series on business-oriented and strategy-related topics is to present a different perspective on Machine Learning (ML). Coming from an enterprise-start-up setting, I will reference somewhat current works that at their core do not deal with the technology (libraries, frameworks, model architectures, algorithms) itself as their primary focal point, but rather aim to explore ML from a (general-purpose) technology and influence perspective. I believe, the field has already great coverage of the technological advancements made in either arena relating to ML, Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Data Analytics.</description>

      <description>Dear readership,
In the past, when it came to content for this blog, I have mostly ventured into Python-based game development with our Elisa series. Surely, this is an important part of my personal interests and hopefully it is of some value to you. At the same time I have to recognize that while ideas are plentiful the creation of content takes time and is typically balanced with the many areas that demand our attention family and business among the most prominent ones.</description>
